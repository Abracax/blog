<li>“Idealist”: “someone who only does not admit that it [the existence of external objects of sense] is cognized through immediate perception and infers form this that we can never be fully certain of their reality from any possible experience.”</li>
<li>“Transcendental”: the specific mode of cognition : “by means of which we cognize that and how certain representations… are applied entirely a priori (does not depend on sensory perception), or are possible.”</li>
<li>Transcendental idealism: “the doctrine that they [all appearances] are all together to be regarded as mere representations and not as things in themselves, and accordingly that space and time are only sensible forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of objects as things in themselves.”</li>
<li>Space and time are not real things in themselves, nor are they appearances of things that we intuit</li>
<li>Because our sensory perception can only cognize objects in space and time, this form of intuition—an active process on the part of the subject of cognition—is a necessary precondition for external things to actually appear to us.</li>
<li>We are not merely passive receivers of sensory data external to us. Our minds actually play an active organizing role in perceiving and understanding objects external to us.</li>
